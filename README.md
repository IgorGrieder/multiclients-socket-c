# Project

This project was done in an operating systems class at UFMG and the idea was to create a multi threaded server/client bet game in C. TCP Sockets were used to communciate between the clients and the server using POSIX threads.

# How to play 

The bet game can be played in a max of 10 clients connected at the same time and to play it you just need to clone this git repo and run the following commands

```bash
make
```

## Run server

```bash
./bin/server
```

## Run client

```bash
./bin/client
```
